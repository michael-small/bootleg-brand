      <b>Brian Bently</b> is our agile ninja master. Tired of scrumbag managers,
      Brian quit his junior web developer job at Amerzon to bring a soft but
      commanding leadership to the Company™ developer team. When he isn't
      perfecting his pong pong game or writing an agenda for his next standup
      meeting, Brian is running our in-house productivity pub.
